# Variables in Python

a = 10
# a is our variable and we are assigning 10 to it
# if we use:
print(a)
# the console will return 10 to us in the console

# again we will create another variable
b = 40

# when we use the console and ask to print(b), we will get 40
# moving to more complex variables
c = a + b

# when we use print(c) we will get 50 in the console

# this will not save is just using the console and will only save for use during the session
# can also store strings as long as you remember to use '' or ""

# Removing variable data
del variable
