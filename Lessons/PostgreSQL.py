#  How Code Execution works
# Input => Python Code => Output => Console
    # Usually when console is closed and code stops running, information is lost
    # If we want to save the input/output even if code stops, we save it to Databases.

# Why would we want to store our data?
    # By storing data, we are about to perform these operations:
        # Can read the data when we want without running our code
            # Ex: Banking Application
        # Can update/modify data
            # Ex: Updating addresses/name/contact info
        # Can delete data

# Data is stored in the form of tables
    # EX: ID, Name, Address, Phone Number. These are attributes of a person.
