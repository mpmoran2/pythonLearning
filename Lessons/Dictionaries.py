# Dictionaries are data structures used to map arbitrary keys to values.
# They help you capture data and store it in the code
# Taking that data, manipulating it, and giving a certian output
# Ex: You want to find the meaning of cloud. You would look it up in the dictionary and get the meaning of the word
# In pairs. Key and value

# EX Code: Saving the ages of people in code
people = {"Pilahi":29, "Morgan":28} # Dictionaries are in curly braces and come in key:value pairs
print(people["Morgan"]) # To look up the value of a key you need to state the dictionary name[key]
# We are telling python to map the key we give to the value that is associated to it

# fun example
cute = {"Sheep":"Yes", "Otter":"Yes", "Mole Rat":"Hell No"}
print(cute["Mole Rat"])
