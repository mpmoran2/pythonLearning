print('Hello World')
# this will return Hello World in the console like our first lesson

# We can also simply use the following:
'Hello World'
# The console will return 'Hello World' to us. The same will go for the following:
"Hello World"

# Problems: Sentences with 's, 're can mess that up
'He's a good guy'
# This brings out a Syntax error. To get past this, you need to use a \
'He\'s a good guy'
# \ tells python that 's is part of the sentence, not the end of the string
# This can be got around as well by using "" vs ''
