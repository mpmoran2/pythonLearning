print('Hello World')
# in the console, will get back Hello World

200 + 300
# in the console, will get 500

200 - 300
# in the console, will get -100

75 * 32
# in the console, will get 2400

5 * 6(5 + 89)
# in the console, will get an error. Must write it as follows:
5 * 6 * (5 + 89)
# we need to multiply the result of 5*6 with the sum of 5+89

# There are two ways to do division in python
500 / 100
# In the console, we get a float of 5.0 however, if we use
500 // 100
# in the console, we get 5

# like many languages, we cannot divide by 0 and will get an error.

# Float notes: if you use floats in your equation, value will be float
6.0 * 3
# value will come out as 18.0
6 * 3
# value will come out as 18
