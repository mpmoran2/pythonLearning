#intro to more math in python
#exponent use x**x
2**2 #this is 2 to the power of 2 and should give us 4 in the console

2**3 #2 to the power of 3 should give is 8

#square root uses x**(1/2)
49**(1/2) #the square root is 7. Since 1/2 is .5 our answer will be a float 7.0

#remainders x%x
7/3 #this gets us 2.3333333333333335 if we want to see the remainder
7%3 #this will give us 1 and is useful to see if it is odd or even

3984%2 #if the answe is 0 it is even, if 1 it is odd

#exercise from Instructor
7%(5//2)
# 1
#logic behind this: 5//2 will be 2 since x//x gets rid of float
# % will give us a remainder and 7%2 is 1 as there is a remainder of 1 so answer will be 1
